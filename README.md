### Notice
I have no X-Station hardware anymore, further development has been halted.

## Novation X-Station Voice Editor

What can it do:

- Send / receive almost all the parameters via SysEx / MIDI CC messages
- Save / Load MIDI Bulk SysEx dump files to / from X-Station
- Save / Load single programs  as *.syx files
- Receiving MIDI bulk dumps directly from device

This panel have some limitations – for example after “offline” parameters edited, entire patch data is sending via sysex because X-Station is not able to control these parameters in realtime.

### Download
All files are available to download on the [latest Release](https://github.com/inteyes/X-Station-Voice-Editor/releases/latest) page of this repository. Be sure to check it out and grab the file that suits your needs.

### Afterword
This panel was created using great [Ctrlr software](https://github.com/RomanKubiak/ctrlr). While you are able to run Ctrlr on your system - you are able to run this panel.<br>
